I am a Research Scientist at IBM Research, Yorktown Heights. Previously, I completed my Ph.D. student at the University of Pennsylvania: Department of Computer and Information Science, advised by Prof. [Dan Roth](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~danroth/) in the [Cognitive Computation Group](https://cogcomp.seas.upenn.edu/). My research broadly focuses on Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing, with the objective of improving the reasoning capabilities of machine learning models for robust generalization.
