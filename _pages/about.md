I am a Research Scientist at IBM Research, Yorktown Heights. Previously, I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Pennsylvania: Department of Computer and Information Science, advised by Prof. [Dan Roth](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~danroth/) in the [Cognitive Computation Group](https://cogcomp.seas.upenn.edu/). Before that, I obtained my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur, where I was awarded the President of India Gold Medal. My research broadly focuses on Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing, with the goal of developing reliable, robust models that are efficient, able to reason, and are aligned with societal values.
